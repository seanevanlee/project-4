# DOTA2: Create a new hero!

As of January 2023, there are currently 123 playable heroes. A hero has three traits -- intelligence, strength, and agility. Each hero has one of these three traits as the highest and combined with unique skills, each hero is truly one of a kind.

The major DOTA tournament, The International, is a popular time to realise a new hero idea and 2023's is no exception. A new hero, Muerta, will be shown.

A lot of thinking goes into creating a new hero and certainly DOTA's developer studio, Valve, has a world-class team to innovate. However, I wonder if Valve ever takes into consideration what the fans want?

##### Next Steps:

Since this project revolves around DOTA2, there are always areas of improvement on the product roadmap. A great next step is to incorporate the DOTA and/or Steam API to enhance a user's experience with real-time stats. This project is social-driven so other features of popular social media apps are also good such as incorporating SEO-based hashtags as well as like/dislike voting systems.
